A virtual tephra microscope exercise

The attached web page contains two tephra exercises. 
1. The first exercise requires the user to become familiar with different shard morphologies and creates virtual slides including tephra from Iceland and the Laacher See tephra. In the exercise the user must click on objects they consider to be tephra and if they are correct they will be highlighted green. If they are incorrect it will highlight the image in red.
2. The second exercise requires the user to count 15 virtual slides. The exercise begins at the start and once the user believes they have identified all the tephra on the virtual slide they click on the 'next slide' button and repeat this until all slides are completed. Once all fifteen slides are completed the correct answer will be revealed below the slide and a comparison to the users attempt to count the slide.
